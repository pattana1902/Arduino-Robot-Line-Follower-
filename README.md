# Robot Line Tracing with Arduino Nano

This repository contains the code and resources for a line tracing robot built using an Arduino Nano, 4 sensors, and 2 motors. The robot is programmed to follow a line on the ground using the sensor inputs to adjust its movements.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Nano
- 4 line tracing sensors (e.g., infrared sensors)
- 2 DC motors
- L293D motor driver
- Breadboard or PCB for circuit connections
- Jumper wires
- Power source (e.g., batteries or external power supply)
- Chassis and wheels for the robot

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- USB cable for uploading code to Arduino Nano

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the hardware components according to the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and connect your Arduino Nano to your computer using the USB cable.
4. Navigate to the downloaded repository and open the `line_tracing_robot.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
5. Compile and upload the code to the Arduino Nano by clicking on the "Upload" button in the IDE.

## Circuit Diagram

A circuit diagram illustrating the connections between the Arduino Nano, sensors, motor driver, and motors is provided in the repository. Ensure that the connections are made correctly to avoid any damage to the components.

## Usage

1. Power on the robot using the chosen power source.
2. Place the robot on a surface with a line to be traced.
3. The sensors will detect the line, and the robot will adjust its movements accordingly to stay on the line.
4. Observe the robot's behavior and make necessary adjustments to the code or hardware if required.
